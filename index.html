      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am new to computer programming and am looking forward to future challenges/calibrations. My undergrad degree is in agriculture economics and commercial real estate finance from Texas A&M, I was looking for a change and stumbled upon this Bootcamp. I do not know much about computers, let alone programming, but life is not about the destination; it is about the journey. I have always had an interest in computer science but never wanted to get involved until I could fully emerge myself into the environment, that time is now, I look forward to the growth potential between now and March.</p>
